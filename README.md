## 🎯 Project Overview

**Opti-Monitor** is a lightweight, automated server monitoring solution designed for small healthcare facilities. It provides real-time health monitoring, automatic alerting, and a beautiful web dashboard.

### The Problem I Solved

Small healthcare clinics often lack IT resources to monitor their critical systems. When servers crash:
- 📅 Patient appointments are lost
- 🌐 Online booking systems fail
- 👨‍⚕️ Staff waste time troubleshooting
- 😞 Patients have poor experiences

### My Solution

An automated monitoring system that:
- ✅ Checks server health every 5 minutes automatically
- ✅ Alerts when issues are detected
- ✅ Provides a beautiful, real-time web dashboard
- ✅ Maintains logs for troubleshooting
- ✅ Requires zero maintenance once set up
